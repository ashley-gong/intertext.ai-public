## Augmented Close Reading for Classical Latin using AI for Intertextual Exploration

Ashley Gong, senior thesis, Harvard CS and Classics, 2024-2025.

Intertextuality is a critical literary concept in the analysis of Latin texts from classical antiquity. Given the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in digital humanities for the Classics and the potential to bridge technology with the process of close reading, this project contributes a novel interface combining Latin BERT (Bamman and Burns 2020), a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned on classical Latin texts, and design choices from popular online Latin reading platforms.
